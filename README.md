## Purpose of the Project
The purpose of the project is to create a personal website that will contain various items related to my favorite fighting game communities such as art, reddit posts or twitter posts.

## Why Make this Project
I would say I am a part of 2 fighting game communities which are Guilty Gear and Tekken. However, I realized I was not as invested in these communities as I thought I was when I was unaware that a Tekken tournament took place where the 2 best players faced each other in the grand finals. (See Video Below)
