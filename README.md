## Purpose of the Project
The purpose of the project is to create a personal website that will contain various items related to my favorite fighting game communities such as art, reddit posts or twitter posts. The primary fighting games it will pull items from is Guilty Gear Strive and Tekken 7.

## Why Make this Project
I would say I am a part of 2 fighting game communities which are Guilty Gear and Tekken. However, I realized I was not as invested in these communities as I thought I was when I was unaware that a Tekken tournament took place where the 2 best players faced each other in the grand finals. (See Video to the Right) [Tekken 7 OneEsport Tournament](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWLb85-z95U)

If you love Tekken, this tournament was really exciting to watch. I did not see this tournament live and only saw it afterwards from a different Youtuber who covered it. It made me realize that searching for stuff like this is time consuming. Add onto another fighting game with its own tournaments and it becomes very difficult to stay up to date in each community. This project, I aim to have some content from each community into 1 website so I can browse both communities at once.

## Current Plan
So far I only plan to make this website for my personal use. How things are currently, I don't have the abilities to make this into an actual website that with a large userbase. However if I do improve and gain abilities to do so, I will attempt to turn this website into a CRUD where users can create accounts to display whatever fighting game communities they want to see.

## Technologies Used
I used Vite to help me create the project with the comman npm vite@latest. I chose Javascript as the programming language as well as the React.js framework. I also used Node.js to be able to run a local server of my website to see the changes I make. Finally, I used HTML to display webpages and CSS to give styling to components.
